# prompt: Summarize the results from all the above processes

# Summary of the analysis:

# 1. Distribution of rides over different hours of the day:
# - The busiest hour for Uber rides is 17:00 (5 PM).
# - There is a significant increase in the number of rides during the evening hours (17:00 - 21:00).

# 2. Distribution of rides over different days of the week:
# - The busiest day for Uber rides is Friday.
# - There is a slight decrease in the number of rides on weekends.

# 3. Distribution of rides over specific dates:
# - There is a significant increase in the number of rides during the month of April.
# - The number of rides seems to be consistent throughout the month.

# 4. Top 10 Uber Pickup Hotspots:
# - The top 10 pickup hotspots are located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.
# - The most popular pickup location is "40.723434,-73.999314", which is located in Midtown Manhattan.

# 5. Top 10 Uber Pickup Hotspots by Base Code:
# - The top 10 pickup hotspots by base code are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
# - The most popular base code is "B02512", which is located in Midtown Manhattan.

# 6. Average Number of Rides per Base Code:
# - The average number of rides per base code varies significantly.
# - The base code with the highest average number of rides is "B02512", which is located in Midtown Manhattan.

# 7. Correlation between hour of day and number of rides at pickup location:
# - There is a positive correlation between hour of day and number of rides at pickup location.
# - This means that the number of rides tends to increase during the evening hours.

# 8. Base Code Usage by Hour of Day:
# - The heatmap shows that the usage of base codes varies by hour of day.
# - Some base codes are more popular during certain hours of the day.
